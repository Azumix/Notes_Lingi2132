\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
This class is about compiler. The goal of compiler is to implement a programming
language. It take source code and make it executable (or pass it to a program
that execute it). We may think that language like Python or JavaScript does not
use compilers however they use it as well! Even if they are dynamical. Note that
this class is not about programming paradigms, it's truly about implementing
languages in general.

We will learn about compilers and their parts, allowing us to understand how
languages works. We will also learn some useful patterns (Domain Specific
Language (DSL), trees, interpreter pattern).
